O que é isto?
=============
Um gerente de Sistemas de Arquivamento Virtual (fsimages) no seu sdcard.

Como utilizar?
================
1) Inicialmente uma custom ROM deve estar instalada na base. Preferencialmente as últimas versões da CM9/CM7 e o último 2nd-init bootmenu.
2) Então instale o defy_multiboot_v0.5.1.zip do m11kkaa. Você pega ele no XDA.
3) Instale  MultiBootManagerFree_v1.22_final_royale1223.apk
4) Agora abra o Mult Boot Manager. Crie novo VFS em opções. Você verá a lista do novo VFS. Você apenas criou o primeiro VFS.
5) Se você precisar de MBM para visualizar as pastas de VFS existentes, coloque os arquivos em /mnt/sdcard/multiboot.
6) Instruções para usar multiboot 0.51 no XDA, agradecimento ao joydeep1985.
7) Se você utilizou leodfs multiboot, reinicie do passo 1. Espero que você possua conhecimento para seguir as orientações.
8) Outras opções do MultiBootManager são auto-explicativas. Favor usar o menu (mantenha menu pressionado).
9) Favor enviar bugs e melhorias desejadas. Estou ocupado mas implementarei as atualizações em breve.
10) Este aplicativo roda em sistemas virtuais também. 
11) Este aplicativo funciona nas ROMs GB e ICS com 2nd init."</string>
